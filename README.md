# OneMustFall

description: Thanks for taking a look at my game triFighter. It is a super fun and wild ride learning how everything
            works. If you are looking at this game and making your own phaserjs game awesome! I only have one piece of 
            advice to add, especially if you are new to coding. If you are not taking a course on how to
            build a game, I highly suggest it, and if you are, don't be afraid to jump in and out from it to your game.
            While I stumbled more when not directly following the course material I found I learned so much more aside
            from phaser. Then when I jumped back into the course, after my stumbles led to complete road blocks, everything
            was so much clearer.

evenFurther: The dev environment was parcel 2.0.0-nightly.389+288396a5 and browser-sync 2.27.4 in a mac or ubuntu 
            environment.  It was kinda a pain to set up, making sure I had the right compatible version. But once I did it was easy. Dont listen to the versions in the link.
