One Must Fall

Description

  -Thanks for taking a look at my game triFighter. It is a super fun and wild ride learning how everything works. If you are looking at this game and making your own phaserjs game awesome! I only have one piece of advice to add, especially if you are new to coding. If you are not taking a course on how to build a game, I highly suggest it, and if you are, don't be afraid to jump in and out from it to your game. While I stumbled more when not directly following the course material I found I learned so much more aside from phaser. Then when I jumped back into the course, after my stumbles led to complete road blocks, everything was so much clearer.
